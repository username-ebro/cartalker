# CarTalker - Elevator Pitch

**After a service:** Snap a photo of your receipt and Tireman tracks all your car maintenance—oil changes, tire rotations, everything. It's your digital glovebox, no spreadsheets needed.

**Not sure if it's due?** When your mechanic recommends something expensive and you're thinking "wait, didn't I just do that?"—CarTalker pulls up your records and tells you if it's actually due based on your mileage, or if you've got another year to go.

**Save money:** When you do need work done, it finds well-reviewed shops nearby, checks online prices for OEM parts, and drafts emails or talking points to help you negotiate the best deal.
